            1. It was mocking me. I know it was mocking me. It was mocking me because it knew I could see it. And it knew that I had never seen it before. I had never seen it before.
            <br><br>
            2. Yesternight I put my eyes so close to the mirror that all I could see was a 2D surface stretching far beyond the outer limits of my vision.
            <br><br>
            3. It knew that I couldn't hurt it. It was smiling because I couldn't hurt it. I couldn't hurt it because hurting it is hurting myself. And there is no pain in hurting myself. I wish there were pain in hurting myself.
            <br><br>
            4. My world then was one image: my face looking back at me. It had an ugly smirk. It had an ugly smirk and vile eyes. 
            <br><br>
            5. I am pure and I am clean. I am Bramha's spinal fluid.
            <br><br>
            6. I could speak to it. For the first time I could speak to the root of my despair. I tried speaking some sense into the root of my despair. I can't speak sense into the root of my despair. Because it knows everything I know. But I know nothing of it. I know nothing of what it will destroy next.
            <br><br>
            7. I hit it. I hit it below its left eye. And it hit me back. It hit me below my right eye. 
            <br><br>
            8. Then it fed me a taste. A taste I had forgotten. A taste that used to make me seek love from what hits me. 
            <br><br>
            9. I humiliated it. I humiliated it by breaking its crown. It looks uglier now. I will humiliate it further. I will humiliate it until it breaks.
            <br><br>
            10. I stripped it of its clothes. I stripped it naked and I took it out in the moonlight. I made it kneel there for an hour. 
            <br><br>
            11. It fled. It fled when I looked away. Then it came back. It came back without form. Without form, it's everywhere. Now it's everywhere.
            <br><br>
            12. It looks at me when I close my eyes. It's not there when I open it. I'm scared to blink.
