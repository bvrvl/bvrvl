Broken straw in a coffee mug,
when lights go out and silence is here,
the defense in your head that keeps you sane
is breached and the darkness is held back no more.
You run for your life but there’s no refuge safe
to guard your skin, keep your hands humane.
Don’t speak a word, don’t sigh a breath,
you’re cornered now, submit yourself.
Your tools are gone, you’ve got no aid, 
No dice to roll, no coins to flip.
The might of words has failed you now
where do you go? who calls your name?
