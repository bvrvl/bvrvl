    <h1>poorly knit sweater</h1>

    <div class="post-content">
        <pre class="poem">
when you felt cold,
i knit a sweater too,
 but i ran out of wool

i run out of wool always
though i know its the same yarn as everyone's
  i am sorry

i am not jealous
but when i look at the sweaters they offer you
  i can't help but look at mine

my poorly knit sweater
it's an embarrassment; i'd rather not
  i am sorry

i can't beg you for more wool
you have given me much
  i was your special

i look at all i've ever done
and i find mountains of performance
  more than the traces of intention

and sometimes i wonder,
if it's the wool that's not enough
  or if it's my bad luck hands

please chop them off
