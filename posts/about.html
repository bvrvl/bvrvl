        <p style="margin-top: 1em;">My name is Saurabh Baral.</p>
        <p><b>I build</b> things. Some of them break, some don't. You'll find traces of them on <a href="https://github.com/bvrvl" target="_blank">github.com/bvrvl</a>. The source code for this website lives there, among other projects.</p>
        <p><b>I walk.</b> Mostly to get to places but sometimes just for the sake of it. I like walking without thinking where I am headed.</p>
        <p><b>I write</b> sometimes. When I do, I'll post it here.</p>
        <p> I have watched these movies and TV shows: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur163089980/ratings/?ref_=hm_nv_rat&sort=top_rated%2Cdesc">IMDB</a></p>
        <p> These were my top songs in 2024: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1FoAXvRwop6jzJ?si=85853ea8554a4e05">Spotify</a></p>
